ONI is a remote backdoor and a project I'm working on my free time.

It has two basic components:

- CLIENT (uses Python)
  Features: Remote Shell (also sends the output of the command and if there is any error while trying to execute your shell will return       error code)

- SERVER (uses PHP + MySQL)
